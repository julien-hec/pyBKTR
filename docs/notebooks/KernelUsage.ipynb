We can configure their initial values (`value`), their sampling bounds (`lower_bound`, `upper_bound`) and we can even keep those parameter constant during the whole sampling (set `is_constant` to `True`).\n",

    "According to the nature of the coordinates, the user can also chose which distance type `DIST_TYPE` he wants to use when calculating the distance matrices from the `kernel_x` passed to the regressor. Let's say we have geographical coordinates, it makes sense to use `DIST_TYPE.HAVERSINE` but not so much sense to use `DIST_TYPE.LINEAR`. Our general rule of thumb would be the following:\n",

    "* Use `DIST_TYPE.HAVERSINE` for geographical locations\n",
    "* Use `DIST_TYPE.EUCLIDEAN` for coordinates 2D coordinates (not geographical) or coordinates with 3+ dimensions\n",
