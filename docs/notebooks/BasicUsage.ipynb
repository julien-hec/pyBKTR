    "It is interesting to note that the package use default kernels and distance calculation methods that we think most users will want to use. By default, the `BKTRRegressor` use a Matern kernel $\\frac{3}{2}$ and the haversine distance for the spatial coordinates, meaning that the `spatial_kernel_x` should have a dimension of $S$ x $2$ for (longitude, latitude). For temporal coordinates we use a SE Kernel by default with linear distance for the temporal coordinates meaning the `temporal_kernel_x` should have a dimension of $T$ x $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the `rank_decomp` parameter represent the rank of the decomposition used in the BKTR algorithm, in general a higher rank have the possibility to give more precise results at the cost of computation time. The `burn_in_iter` and `sampling_iter` params are used to dertermine the number of iterations of the algorithm, the `burn_in_iter` represent the number of iterations before we start the sampling (helps to the parameters to converge before starting the sampling phase) and the `sampling_iter` is the number of iterations used for sampling.\n",
